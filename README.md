CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains Python code to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck


## Model Architecture
The CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras:

Input Layer: 32x32x3 RGB image
Convolutional Layers:
32 filters of size 3x3 with ReLU activation
Max pooling with 2x2 window
64 filters of size 3x3 with ReLU activation
Max pooling with 2x2 window
64 filters of size 3x3 with ReLU activation
Fully Connected Layers:
Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
Output layer with 10 units (corresponding to class labels)
Training
The model is trained with:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
Metrics: Accuracy
Evaluation
After training for 10 epochs, the model achieves a test accuracy of [insert your test accuracy here]% on unseen data.

## Requirements
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
## Usage
To predict the class of a new image, use the predict_image function defined in predict.py. Ensure the image is resized to 32x32 pixels and normalized before prediction.

python
```
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"
predicted_class_name = predict_image(image_path)
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class_name}")
```
